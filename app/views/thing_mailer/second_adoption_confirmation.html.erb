  Wow! You adopted another drain. Thank you.
</p>

<p>
  Did you know? You also can <a
    href="http://sfdpw.org/index.aspx?page=1229">Adopt-a-Street.</a> In
  addition to cleaning your catch basin, you and a neighborhood group can adopt
  an area and take responsibility for helping to keep the street and sidewalk
  there clean. In return, you get to flex your civic pride and the City will
  provide free rakes, brooms, street cleaning supplies, and litter and
  compostable leaf bag pickup.
